title: Output formats
description: text, json, json-strict, and quiet modes — what each format emits, the JSON envelope, and how --suppress-reads affects payloads.
---

`acpx` streams agent activity in three output modes plus two modifiers. Pick the one that matches your consumer: a human terminal, an automation pipeline, or a script that only wants the final answer.

Explicit top-level output flags also apply when configuration fails to load: JSON modes emit one JSON-RPC error on stdout, quiet mode emits one stderr diagnostic, and text mode reports the error without a stack trace. If no output flag is supplied and configuration cannot load, errors use text mode.

## `text` (default)

Human-readable stream:

- assistant text as it arrives
- `[thinking]` blocks for reasoning chunks
- `[tool] <title> (<status>)` blocks with output, diff previews, and plan updates
- `[done] <stopReason>` at the end

```bash
acpx codex 'review the auth module'
```

```text
[thinking] Reading src/auth and looking for token validation
[tool] Read src/auth/index.ts (completed)
[tool] Run grep -n 'verifyToken' src/auth (completed)
  output:
    src/auth/jwt.ts:42:export function verifyToken
The auth module is structured as …
[done] end_turn
```

`text` is best for interactive use. It is **not** stable for parsing — error messages, prompts, and progress updates can change between releases.

## `json`

NDJSON stream of raw ACP JSON-RPC messages on stdout:

```bash
acpx --format json codex exec 'review changed files' \
  | jq -r 'select(.method=="session/update")'
```

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"req-1","method":"session/prompt","params":{"sessionId":"019c…","prompt":[{"type":"text","text":"hi"}]}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"session/update","params":{"sessionId":"019c…","update":{"sessionUpdate":"agent_message_chunk","content":{"type":"text","text":"Hello"}}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"req-1","result":{"stopReason":"end_turn"}}
```

Hard rules for `json`:

- No acpx-specific event envelope wrapping ACP messages.
- No synthetic `type` / `stream` / `eventVersion` keys injected onto raw ACP traffic.
- No payload key renaming.

What you read on stdout is the same wire-level JSON that would have crossed the ACP transport, in submission order.

`compare` is the exception because it runs multiple one-shot sessions and emits a summarized `CompareRow[]` payload under `--format json` instead of interleaving raw ACP streams.

stderr can still contain prompts, progress, or warnings. If your script reads only stdout, that is fine. If you pipe both, see `--json-strict` below.

## `--format json --json-strict`

Strict JSON suppresses non-JSON output that would otherwise land on stderr:

```bash
acpx --format json --json-strict codex exec 'list TODO comments' > events.ndjson
```

`--json-strict` requires `--format json`. It guarantees:

- stdout is one ACP JSON-RPC message per line
- stderr stays quiet for non-error informational output

This is the right combination for "fully machine-consumed pipelines that should fail visibly on real errors."

## `quiet`

Final assistant text only — no tool blocks, no thinking, no `[done]`:

```bash
SUMMARY=$(acpx --format quiet codex exec 'one-line summary of this branch')
echo "$SUMMARY"
```

When the adapter includes final token usage and cost metadata in the prompt result, `acpx` emits that to **stderr** in `quiet` mode. stdout stays as the assistant text only.

If a quiet prompt fails, `acpx` exits non-zero and emits exactly one single-line diagnostic to stderr:

```text
[acpx] error: <CODE> [<DETAIL_CODE>] <message>
```

`DETAIL_CODE` is omitted when unavailable. Embedded line endings in the message are replaced with spaces. The diagnostic never goes to stdout; quiet stdout remains reserved for any assistant text the adapter produced. This stderr contract applies to direct and queued prompts; it does not change the `json` or `--json-strict` streams.

Text already received is preserved even when a failed turn has no final ACP response. Quiet session-watch replay also emits buffered text when a failed or cancelled turn settles, without duplicating output from completed turns.

`quiet` is unaffected by `--suppress-reads` because it does not print tool call output to begin with.

## `--suppress-reads`

Replaces raw read-file payloads with a placeholder so logs stay readable when an agent reads a large file:

| Mode    | Effect of `--suppress-reads`                                                            |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`  | Read-like tool outputs render as `[read output suppressed]`.                            |
| `json`  | ACP `fs/read_text_file` responses and read-like tool-call outputs replace raw contents. |
| `quiet` | No effect (quiet mode prints assistant text only).                                      |

```bash
acpx --suppress-reads codex exec 'inspect repo and report tool usage'
```

The replacement preserves the surrounding ACP message shape so json consumers can still parse the stream — only the content payload is masked.

Live JSON read suppression keeps file responses separate from overlapping control
responses, even when the client and agent use the same request ID. This requires
an updated client and queue owner; older owners and saved raw session journals
retain their existing behavior when transport direction is unavailable.

Title-based read detection uses complete leading words such as `Read`, `cat`,
`Open`, and `View`; a filename or substring in another action's title does not
suppress that action's output.

## Session-control command output

Session controls and queries emit command-specific JSON documents under `--format json`:

| Command                                         | `text`                                                                    | `json`                                                                                | `quiet`                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Agent-side `sessions list`                      | TSV: `sessionId title cwd updatedAt meta`, plus next cursor when supplied | `{ source: "agent", sessions, ... }`; optional `_meta`, `cursor`, `cwd`, `nextCursor` | one adapter session id per line |
| Local `sessions list --local` or local fallback | TSV: local id, name, cwd, last-used time                                  | array of full local session records                                                   | one local record id per line    |
| `sessions show`                                 | key/value metadata                                                        | full local session record                                                             | local record id                 |
| `sessions history`                              | session summary and TSV history entries                                   | `{ id, sessionId, limit, count, entries }`                                            | one text preview per line       |
| `sessions prune`                                | summary plus pruned ids and time                                          | `{ action, dryRun, count, bytesFreed, pruned }`                                       | one pruned id per line          |
| `sessions new`/`ensure`                         | local record id and creation/replacement summary                          | `session_ensured` result with `created` and local session identity                    | local record id                 |
| `status`                                        | key/value status summary                                                  | `status_snapshot` result                                                              | state token                     |

Closed records are marked `[closed]` in local-list text and quiet output.

## Identity fields in JSON

JSON field names depend on the command. Local lifecycle/control summaries and a status result with a matching record use these identity fields:

| Field            | Meaning                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `acpxRecordId`   | Local acpx record id                                     |
| `acpxSessionId`  | ACP session id stored by that record                     |
| `agentSessionId` | Optional provider-native id, when exposed by the adapter |

Full local records, returned by `sessions show` and local listing, name their ACP session field `acpSessionId`. Agent-side listing uses each adapter entry's `sessionId` and does not add local record identity. History, export/import, prune, and `no-session` status results have their own documented summary shapes; do not require the three fields above on every JSON result.

Do not assume a local record id can be passed to a native provider CLI. Use `agentSessionId` when the adapter supplies one.

## Picking a mode

| Use case                                  | Pick                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Interactive use, you are the reader       | `text` (default)                          |
| Save full transcript for later replay     | `json` (or `--format json --json-strict`) |
| Pipe into `jq` and parse events           | `--format json` or `--json-strict`        |
| Capture only the final answer in a script | `--format quiet`                          |
| Long agent runs that read large files     | add `--suppress-reads`                    |
| Anywhere stdout must be 100% JSON         | `--format json --json-strict`             |

## Prompt response metadata

ACP prompt response `_meta` is passed through to compare summaries and embedded
runtime completion results, including queued prompts. An absent field stays
absent, and an explicit `null` stays `null`. Nested values are opaque,
adapter-defined data; ACPX does not authenticate them or treat them as proof of
model identity or configuration. Raw JSON output retains the original ACP response.

## Embedded host logging

Embedded ACP prompts leave the application's `console.error` function unchanged,
including while prompts overlap or the host replaces its logger. Existing output
modes and acpx warning and retry suppression controls keep their behavior.

## Embedded runtime plans

The `acpx/runtime` turn stream exposes ACP plan notifications as `status` events
with `tag: "plan"`. The existing text summary remains available. The optional
`entries` field contains normalized `AcpRuntimePlanEntry` objects with `content`,
`status` (`pending`, `in_progress`, or `completed`), and a valid advertised
`priority` (`high`, `medium`, or `low`) when present.

Each `entries` array replaces the previous plan; `entries: []` clears it. An
omitted field supplies no structured snapshot. Entries with blank content or
invalid status are skipped, and invalid priorities are omitted. Legacy updates
without valid statuses can still produce a text summary. CLI JSON output
continues to expose the original ACP payload.

## Embedded runtime tool calls

The `acpx/runtime` turn stream exposes both ACP `tool_call` and `tool_call_update`
notifications as `tool_call` events, retaining the original tag. The optional
`kind` preserves known ACP classifications, including `switch_mode`. Missing or
unknown kinds are omitted without dropping the tool event.
