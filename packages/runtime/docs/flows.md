description: Multi-step ACP workflows in acpx — define a TypeScript flow, mix acp / action / compute / decision / checkpoint nodes, persist runs, and replay.
---

Flows are how `acpx` runs multi-step ACP work without turning one giant prompt into the workflow engine. They are TypeScript modules that the `acpx/flows` runtime executes step by step, persisting state under `~/.acpx/flows/runs/`.

> Flows are an experimental, opt-in surface. The authoring API is in `acpx/flows`; flows do not change how persistent sessions or `prompt` / `exec` work.

## When to use flows

Reach for a flow when one prompt is not enough — typically because:

- you need a deterministic branch (classify, then route)
- one ACP turn should not also run shell commands or call the GitHub API
- you want each step to be inspectable and replayable
- the workflow is the same across runs, but the input changes

For one-off asks, `acpx codex 'do the thing'` is the right tool. For "run this 6-step PR triage on every PR matching a query," a flow is the right tool.

## Run a flow

```bash
acpx flow run ./my-flow.ts
acpx flow run ./my-flow.ts --input-file ./flow-input.json
acpx flow run ./my-flow.ts --input-json '{"task":"FIX: …"}'
acpx flow run ./my-flow.ts --default-agent claude
acpx --timeout 1800 flow run ./my-flow.ts
```

What happens:

- The runtime loads the flow module from disk.
- A run id is generated and a run directory is created at `~/.acpx/flows/runs/<runId>/`.
- Steps execute in topological order. ACP steps reuse one implicit main session by default.
- Run state (graph, ACP transcripts, artifacts, errors) is persisted as the run progresses.
- The runtime exits when the graph terminates or a checkpoint pauses.

On POSIX systems, run snapshots, projections, artifacts, and event logs use
owner-only file permissions (`0600`); acpx-owned run directories use `0700`.
Existing custom output-root directories keep their permissions. Snapshot writes
publish complete files atomically and clean up failed staging writes. Event logs
remain append-only and retain their existing ordering and size behavior.

`--input-json` and `--input-file` are mutually exclusive ways to provide flow input. `--default-agent` supplies the default agent profile for `acp` nodes that do not pin one.

The CLI resolves `acpx/flows` in the entry module and its imported helpers without rewriting source text or creating files beside the flow. Flows can run from read-only directories. Global `--system-prompt` and `--append-system-prompt` flags are forwarded to every ACP node, including isolated sessions.

## Parsing JSON output

`extractJsonObject(text)` and `parseJsonObject(text, { mode: "compat" })` try
direct JSON, then a fenced JSON block, then balanced objects or arrays embedded
in prose. Compatibility recovery parses candidates as it finds them and bounds
the total scanning and parsing work relative to the input length. Large output
or many separate malformed candidates do not by themselves prevent extraction.

Repeatedly malformed or ambiguous prefixes can exhaust that recovery budget,
including unmatched opening delimiters before a valid object. In that case the
helper throws the usual `Could not parse JSON` error. Prefer direct or fenced
JSON when recovery must not depend on surrounding prose; those parsing paths
are unaffected by the compatibility recovery budget. Use
`parseStrictJsonObject(text)` to require direct JSON, or `mode: "fenced"` to
accept direct JSON and fenced blocks without embedded recovery.

## Node types

Flows are graphs. Each node is one of:

| Node         | Purpose                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `acp`        | A model-shaped step — runs an ACP turn against an agent session.                            |
| `action`     | A deterministic runtime-owned step — typically a shell command or HTTP call.                |
| `compute`    | A pure local function — shape inputs, route, format, derive values.                         |
| `decision`   | A constrained-choice ACP branch — wraps `acp` + `parse` + `switch` for typed routing.       |
| `checkpoint` | A pause point that requires something outside the runtime (human review, external trigger). |

Edges connect nodes. `decisionEdge()` produces typed edges out of a `decision()` node so the routing is explicit and replayable.

The runtime owns:

- graph execution and step ordering
- liveness and timeouts
- ACP session lifecycle
- persistence and replay
- routing through `decision` outcomes

The agent owns reasoning, summarization, and tool calls inside `acp` and `decision` nodes. The flow file does not implement the workflow engine — it declares it.

## Authoring surface

Node IDs and raw switch case keys are exact own string entries, including empty
strings and names such as `__proto__`. Use a computed property such as
`["__proto__"]` when declaring that key in JavaScript. Inherited properties do not
declare nodes, cases, or edge routing fields.

Define a flow with `defineFlow` from `acpx/flows`:

```ts
import { acp, decision, decisionEdge, defineFlow } from "acpx/flows";

type TriageInput = {
  task: string;
};

const classifyChoices = ["bug", "feat", "doc"] as const;

export default defineFlow({
  name: "triage",
  startAt: "classify",
  nodes: {
    classify: decision({
      question: ({ input }) => `Classify: ${(input as TriageInput).task}`,
      choices: classifyChoices,
    }),
    fix: acp({
      prompt: ({ input }) => `Implement and verify: ${(input as TriageInput).task}`,
    }),
    write_doc: acp({
      prompt: ({ input }) => `Draft docs entry for: ${(input as TriageInput).task}`,
    }),
  },
  edges: [
    decisionEdge({
      from: "classify",
      choices: classifyChoices,
      cases: {
        bug: "fix",
        feat: "fix",
        doc: "write_doc",
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

This flow expects input such as `{"task":"Fix the reconnect bug"}`. Callbacks receive it through `input`; the TypeScript assertion does not validate it at runtime. See `examples/flows/branch.flow.ts` for another small `decision()` example.

## Workspace isolation

`acp` nodes can set a per-step working directory from an earlier node's output:

```ts
acp({
  cwd: ({ outputs }) => (outputs.prepare_workspace as { workdir: string }).workdir,
  prompt: ({ input }) => `Run inside the prepared workspace: ${(input as { task: string }).task}`,
});
```

This fragment assumes an earlier `prepare_workspace` node returns `{ workdir: string }` and an edge connects it to this ACP node. A `cwd` string is a literal path; use a callback to read prior outputs. `examples/flows/workdir.flow.ts` shows a shell action creating a temporary directory and an ACP node using it.

Persistent ACP steps reuse a session when their resolved command, explicit argument vector (when supplied), working directory, and session handle match. Different profile names may share a session when those values match. Argument boundaries and empty arguments are significant. Each step snapshots its resolved arguments, so a custom resolver reusing an array cannot change earlier step metadata.

## Permissions

Flows can declare an explicit permission requirement. If a flow needs `approve-all` and you forget the flag, `acpx` fails fast before the first step runs and prints the flag to add:

```bash
acpx flow run examples/flows/pr-triage/pr-triage.flow.ts \
  --input-json '{"repo":"openclaw/acpx","prNumber":150}'
# error: this flow requires --approve-all
```

```bash
# correct
acpx --approve-all flow run examples/flows/pr-triage/pr-triage.flow.ts \
  --input-json '{"repo":"openclaw/acpx","prNumber":150}'
```

This is a guardrail for flows that make real changes — the PR-triage example can comment on or close GitHub PRs against a live repo.

## Run persistence

Each run produces a bundle under `~/.acpx/flows/runs/<runId>/`:

- step-by-step graph state with inputs and outputs
- ACP transcripts for every `acp` and `decision` step
- artifacts written by `action` steps (when the step opts in)
- final result or error

Bundles are immutable once a run terminates. They are the input for the [replay viewer](#replay-viewer).

When an ACP prompt settles, its pending capture writes finish before the step result is recorded. Capture failures fail the step; if the agent also fails, its original prompt error remains visible and is saved with the run. Admitted heartbeat and session-bundle writes also finish before the next step or terminal snapshot is published. Concurrent runs on one runner keep their pending ACP clients separate.

## Timeouts

Every node uses the global `--timeout` value as its default per-step timeout. If `--timeout` is not set, flows default to **15 minutes per active step**. Override per step in the flow definition when needed. One deadline covers preparation, execution, parsing, and admitted runtime writes.

Callbacks receive `context.signal`, which aborts on timeout or interruption. After cancellation, the runtime denies new adapter launches, ACP requests, and managed shell commands, and waits for already owned work and cleanup before recording the outcome. Persistent ACP reconnection loads the same backend session; a failed load fails the step without creating a replacement session.

Function actions also receive `context.runShell` for native commands:

```ts
action({
  run: async (context) => {
    const result = await context.runShell!({
      command: "git",
      args: ["status", "--short"],
      timeoutMs: 30_000,
    });
    return { changedFiles: result.stdout, exitCode: result.exitCode, timedOut: result.timedOut };
  },
});
```

`runShell` waits for complete stdout and stderr, returns ordinary nonzero exits as results, and returns `timedOut: true` with partial output when its own deadline expires. Cancellation of the enclosing node rejects instead, after process cleanup; catching that error cannot authorize another managed command. The fields are optional on the shared `FlowNodeContext` type for compatibility with manually constructed contexts, but `FlowRunner` supplies the signal to every node and `runShell` to function actions.

Arbitrary callback JavaScript cannot be forcibly stopped. Check `context.signal` before starting your own side effects and after awaits, or use `runShell` for owned native commands. The runner does not wait forever for an uncooperative callback and does not roll back completed external effects. The PR-triage example uses these boundaries for its commands and file writes.

A shell action's `timeoutMs: 0` disables its own deadline; an enclosing node deadline still applies. Node and command deadlines must be finite and no greater than 2,147,483,647 milliseconds. Invalid command deadlines or non-string `stdin` values are rejected before spawning. On expiry or interruption, acpx cancels active shell commands and waits for termination and output-stream cleanup before reporting cancellation. Cleanup failures are reported instead of silently claiming cleanup succeeded. An executor that resolves after its node has timed out or been interrupted cannot launch a new shell process.

A shell node drains its wrapper's final stdout and stderr after exit, waiting for pipe closure for up to 100 milliseconds. Inherited pipes from a surviving descendant do not keep a completed flow's host alive beyond that drain window. While other work keeps the host running, these pipes continue draining without extending the completed result.

Set `maxBufferBytes` on the object returned by `shell().exec` to limit captured stdout and stderr independently. The value is a non-negative safe integer counting UTF-8 bytes; omission preserves unlimited capture, and zero permits empty output only. Overflow fails the action even with `allowNonZeroExit`, stops retaining output, and waits for the existing process-tree cleanup before returning the error. A timeout or cancellation already in progress keeps its original result.

On POSIX, cleanup covers the owned process group and descendants discoverable before it is signalled, including descendants that move to another process group while their wrapper is active. Successful command completion still follows the wrapper's exit. A child that deliberately starts a separate session with independent stdio and is reparented before cancellation can outlive the flow, as before; acpx does not provide persistent supervision of escaped daemons.

## Replay viewer

`examples/flows/replay-viewer/` is a browser app that visualizes saved run bundles:

- React Flow graph with per-node status
- recent-runs picker (live over WebSocket — in-progress runs update without refresh)
- ACP session inspection per step
- rewind/scrub through the run timeline

Run from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm viewer
```

The viewer is read-only. It opens a saved bundle and lets you inspect what happened; it does not re-run the flow.

Malformed HTTP or WebSocket input is rejected without stopping the viewer.
Corrupt bundle metadata is skipped, and transient read failures do not prevent
subsequent live updates. Opening or reconnecting another viewer preserves updates
for clients that are already subscribed.

If polling overlaps an atomic replacement of a live projection, the recent-runs
list and selected run retain their last readable state until polling succeeds.
A missing optional live projection still falls back to the saved run projection.

## Example flows in the source tree

Under `examples/flows/`:

- `echo.flow.ts` — minimal one-step ACP flow that returns a JSON reply
- `branch.flow.ts` — `decision()` + `decisionEdge()` constrained-choice classification, then a deterministic branch
- `shell.flow.ts` — one runtime-owned shell `action` returning structured JSON
- `workdir.flow.ts` — `action` prepares a temporary workspace, `acp` runs inside that cwd
- `two-turn.flow.ts` — same-session ACP example that uses tools across multiple steps
- `pr-triage/pr-triage.flow.ts` — larger end-to-end example with a written spec; can comment on or close real GitHub PRs against a live repo

The PR-triage example declares an explicit `approve-all` requirement, so it must be run with `--approve-all`.

## Practical examples

```bash
# Smallest possible run
acpx flow run examples/flows/echo.flow.ts \
  --input-json '{"request":"Summarize this repo in one sentence."}'

# decision()/decisionEdge() routing
acpx flow run examples/flows/branch.flow.ts \
  --input-json '{"task":"FIX: add a regression test for the reconnect bug"}'

# Runtime-owned shell action
acpx flow run examples/flows/shell.flow.ts \
  --input-json '{"text":"hello from shell"}'

# Multi-turn same-session work
acpx flow run examples/flows/two-turn.flow.ts \
  --input-json '{"topic":"How should we validate a new ACP adapter?"}'

# Live PR triage (declares approve-all)
acpx --approve-all flow run examples/flows/pr-triage/pr-triage.flow.ts \
  --input-json '{"repo":"openclaw/acpx","prNumber":150}'
```
