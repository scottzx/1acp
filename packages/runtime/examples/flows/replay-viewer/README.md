# Flow Replay Viewer

This example app visualizes one saved flow run bundle at a time.

For the viewer semantics and UX/layout rules, see
[docs/2026-03-27-flow-replay-viewer.md](../../../docs/2026-03-27-flow-replay-viewer.md).
For the live viewer transport and state-sync model, see
[docs/2026-03-31-flow-replay-live-transport.md](../../../docs/2026-03-31-flow-replay-live-transport.md).

It is separate from the `acpx` CLI surface on purpose:

- `acpx` writes replayable run bundles under `~/.acpx/flows/runs/`
- this viewer reads those bundles and renders them in the browser

The viewer uses:

- the run bundle manifest and projections
- the trace log
- bundled ACP session snapshots and raw session events
- React Flow for the graph

## Run it

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm viewer
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173).

The local viewer server always uses that fixed port. If another replay viewer is
already running there, the command reuses it instead of bouncing to a random
new port.

Useful helper commands:

```bash
pnpm viewer:open
pnpm viewer:status
pnpm viewer:stop
```

Browser HTTP and WebSocket requests must use the viewer's own origin. The server
accepts its configured host, the local address of the connection, and `localhost`
for loopback connections, all at its listening port. Native status, stop, and
WebSocket clients can continue to omit `Origin`. Deliberately binding to a network
interface retains access for native clients on that network.

With a wildcard bind (`--host 0.0.0.0` or `--host ::`), use the listener's numeric
interface address in client URLs. Unconfigured DNS aliases now receive `403`;
to use a hostname, bind with `--host <hostname>` and address the viewer by that
configured hostname. Forwarded headers do not add admitted hostnames.

For IPv6 loopback, use `pnpm viewer --host ::1`; the printed URL uses brackets,
such as `http://[::1]:4173`. Pass the same `--host ::1` to status and stop.

The main path is the built-in **Recent runs** list sourced from:

```text
~/.acpx/flows/runs/<run-id>/
```

If the viewer starts before any runs exist, it stays empty and waits for the
first real run instead of falling back to a demo bundle. New runs appear in the
left sidebar automatically, and the first recent run opens on its own.

Recent runs shows up to 24 readable run summaries. Directories with missing or
unreadable summaries do not use a slot or hide older readable runs.

When a recent run is still active, the sidebar and the selected run view update
live over the viewer WebSocket transport. The viewer keeps the accumulated
history locally, so you can still rewind while new steps continue to arrive.

If polling overlaps an atomic replacement of a live projection, both the recent
runs list and the selected run keep their last readable state until polling
succeeds. A missing optional live projection still falls back to the saved run
projection.

## What it shows

- the flow graph, with replay progression over the saved step attempts
- selected step prompt, raw response, parsed output, and action receipts
- the ACP conversation slice for the selected ACP step
- the raw bundled ACP event slice for that step

Direct loads and live updates reconstruct conversation history from the bundled
session events. Earlier attempts keep their own messages when the runtime's
bounded checkpoint advances, and captured long responses remain readable.
Saved message identities are reused only when the reconstructed history matches
the checkpoint.

Recovery is limited to the data in the bundle. Checkpoint-only bundles retain
their saved content. Incomplete or contradictory history keeps the checkpoint
and raw events without highlighting an unrelated message as the selected turn.
Without a valid checkpoint cursor, captured events are not appended to saved messages.
With a valid cursor, replay stops before the first gap in the following event sequence.
A prepared step with no captured conversation has no highlighted message yet.
Pending setup output stays in raw events until its turn's message boundary is known.
The viewer does not change runtime retention limits or rewrite saved bundles.

The full flow definition remains the main graph. The run is shown as an overlay
on that graph rather than replacing it with an execution-only path.
Unused components, including loops, remain visible even when the run completes
without reaching them.
Dashed return edges follow their final layout direction. A downward branch merge
stays solid even when another path reaches its target sooner.

Graph nodes remain visible during playback, and their cards resize as content changes.
Edges follow measured card sizes and connect to their named handles, keeping routes
outside wrapped labels and outcome rows.
At narrower widths, the graph controls and inspector stack within the viewport;
the run selector becomes a bounded top section. Each section scrolls independently.
Follow mode centers the selected attempt when the graph viewport is replaced,
including runs with matching graph node IDs and layouts.

Replay follows the saved attempt order, including attempts with matching
timestamps. Duration labels carry rounded seconds into the next minute.
When a later step shows an earlier ACP conversation as context, the completed
text stays visible during replay. Progressive reveal belongs to the attempt
that produced the conversation.
Replay timing weights only that attempt's recorded messages, so later output in
the same session does not stretch earlier steps.

The conversation marks the selected ACP slice with a colored rail and background,
while keeping surrounding messages readable when replay is paused.

The conversation pane follows new content during replay and live streaming.
Scrolling upward detaches it, including keyboard and scrollbar movement. Scroll
down near the bottom to resume following. Changing the streaming session or
resuming replay restores follow; updates within the same session preserve a
reader's detached position.

Selecting the displayed run again keeps it selected even if an earlier choice
finishes loading later. A superseded load cannot replace it or show an obsolete error.

Playback advances with elapsed animation time at the selected speed, including
when the displayed run receives an updated bundle.

With the scrubber focused, ArrowLeft/ArrowDown select the previous attempt and
ArrowRight/ArrowUp select the next. Each press stops replay at a complete recorded
attempt. Dragging still previews continuously and snaps to the nearest attempt
on release; Home and End retain their native range behavior. Tabbing into the
scrubber leaves playback running until a seek key is used.

## Included sample

The bundled sample under `public/sample-run/` still exists for development and
test fixtures. It comes from a real run of `examples/flows/two-turn.flow.ts`
against the repo's mock ACP agent, with the machine-specific paths sanitized
for readability.

This is a legacy bundle: its `session_bound.bindingArtifact` references the mutable
binding file and has a stale digest. It remains a reader-compatibility fixture,
not an artifact-integrity example. Newly generated bundles store an immutable
initial binding snapshot; the viewer continues to read current session metadata
through the manifest's `bindingPath`.
